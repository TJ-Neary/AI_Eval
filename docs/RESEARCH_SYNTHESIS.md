## Executive Summary

All three AI research documents converge on several critical themes that are **missing or underdeveloped** in the current AI_Eval DevPlan. This synthesis identifies the highest-priority additions.

---

## Gaps Identified in Current DevPlan

### 🔴 Critical Gaps (Must Add)

| Gap | Current State | Research Finding |
|-----|---------------|------------------|
| **Statistical Rigor** | Basic mean ± std dev | Need 800+ samples for 3% effect detection, clustered SEs, confidence intervals |
| **Benchmark Contamination** | Not addressed | 11-22% performance inflation on contaminated data; need ITD decontamination |
| **LLM-as-Judge Bias** | Not addressed | Position bias, verbosity bias, self-evaluation bias all documented |
| **Drift Detection** | Not addressed | 75% of LLM deployments show degradation without monitoring |
| **TCO Break-Even Calculator** | Mentioned but not spec'd | Clear thresholds: <10K/mo → API, >100K/mo → local |
| **Memory Bandwidth Metrics** | Not tracked | Key bottleneck for local inference; more important than compute |
| **Thermal Throttle Testing** | Not addressed | Consumer GPUs lose 30% speed after 5+ min; need soak tests |

### 🟡 Important Gaps (Should Add)

| Gap | Research Finding |
|-----|------------------|
| **RAG Evaluation (RAGAS)** | Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy, Context Precision, Context Recall |
| **Calibration Testing** | Does model confidence correlate with correctness? |
| **Quantization Comparison** | Q5_K_M is optimal (65% size reduction, 97-98% quality) |
| **Needle-in-Haystack** | Test actual vs. claimed context window |
| **Multi-Language Testing** | 30%+ performance gap between English and low-resource languages |
| **Cold Start vs Hot Start** | Loading 70B model takes 8-13 seconds |
| **Carbon/Energy Tracking** | Up to 70x difference in energy per query between models |

---

## Key Methodologies to Adopt

### 1. Statistical Rigor (From Claude Research)

**Anthropic's 5 Core Practices**:
1. Use CLT for standard errors with 95% CI
2. Cluster SEs for non-independent questions (naive SEM underestimates 3x)
3. Reduce within-question variance via resampling
4. Use paired-difference analysis
5. Conduct power analysis (870 questions for 3% effect at 80% power)

**AI_Eval Action**: Increase minimum test count to 100+ per category; implement bootstrap CIs.

### 2. LLM-as-Judge Best Practices (All Sources)

| Bias | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Position Bias | Randomize answer order in comparisons |
| Verbosity Bias | Penalize unnecessary length in rubric |
| Self-Evaluation Bias | Never have model judge its own output |
| Cost | Use small fine-tuned judges (Galileo Luna: $0.02/M tokens) |

**AI_Eval Action**: Add judge configuration with bias mitigation; support local judge models.

### 3. Hardware Profiling (From Gemini Research)

**Memory Bandwidth Formula**:
```
Max TPS = Memory_Bandwidth_GB/s / Model_Size_GB
e.g., RTX 4090 (1 TB/s) with 70B (140GB) = ~7 TPS theoretical max
```

**Soak Test Protocol**:
- Run continuous inference 15-30 min
- Log GPU temp and clock every 30s
- Calculate: `Degradation% = (TPS_initial - TPS_final) / TPS_initial`

**AI_Eval Action**: Add memory bandwidth utilization (MBU) metric; implement soak test mode.

### 4. TCO Break-Even Thresholds (From Claude Research)

| Monthly Queries | Recommendation | Break-Even |
|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| <10K | Cloud API | N/A |
| 10K-100K | Careful evaluation | 12-36 months |
| >100K | Likely local | 6-18 months |
| >1M | Strongly local | 3-12 months |

**AI_Eval Action**: Implement `ai-eval estimate-tco` command with break-even calculator.

### 5. Benchmark Saturation & Contamination (All Sources)

**Saturated Benchmarks to De-Emphasize**:
- MMLU (saturated Sep 2024, 9%+ error rate in questions)
- HumanEval (164 problems widely contaminated)

**Contamination-Resistant Alternatives**:
- LiveCodeBench (weekly new problems)
- SWE-Bench Verified (500 human-validated)
- GPQA Diamond (PhD-level science)

**Detection Method**: Check for 11-22% score difference between known-contaminated and fresh versions.

### 6. Continuous Drift Monitoring (From Claude Research)

**Key Finding**: 75% of businesses see AI performance decline without monitoring. Models unchanged for 6+ months show 35% error rate increase.

**Monitor**:
- Response length variance (GPT-4 showed 23% over time)
- Instruction adherence
- User feedback thumbs down rate
- Population Stability Index (PSI)

**AI_Eval Action**: Add `ai-eval monitor` command for production tracking.

## Prompt Engineering Research

> Based on 2024-2025 research on model-specific prompting differences.

### Universal Best Practices

- **Clarity & Specificity**: Ambiguity is primary cause of poor output
- **Structured Prompts**: System message + instructions + context + examples + constraints
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Provide 3-5 examples for pattern matching
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: "Think step by step" improves reasoning
- **Output Constraints**: Explicitly state format, length, structure

### Model-Specific Differences

| Model Family | Prompting Style | Key Techniques |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **GPT (OpenAI)** | Streamlined single prompt | Crisp numeric constraints, JSON hints, 128K context |
| **Claude (Anthropic)** | XML-tagged sections | `<instructions>`, `<thinking>` tags; 200K context; direct instructions |
| **Llama (Meta)** | Structure-sensitive | System instructions critical; template-based; sensitive to prompt quality |
| **Gemini (Google)** | Flexible, multimodal | Handles mixed media; benefits from role assignment |

### AI_Eval Prompt Engineering Features

1. **Prompt Sensitivity Testing** (Category 7)
   - Same question, 5 different phrasings → measure variance
   - Model robustness score

2. **Prompt Optimization Recommendations**
   - After test run, suggest model-specific prompt improvements
   - E.g., "Claude performs better with XML tags for this task"

3. **Prompt Library** (Documentation)
   - Best prompt templates per model family
   - Domain-specific prompt patterns (RAG, code, analysis)
